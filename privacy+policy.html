         </ol><p><strong>1. Website Visitors</strong></p>
        
        <p>Like most website operators, Doctor IT Services collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Doctor IT Services's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Doctor IT Services's visitors use its website. From time to time, Doctor IT Services may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
        
        <p>Doctor IT Services also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="https://docits.in">https://docits.in</a> blog posts. Doctor IT Services only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
        
        <p><href="#tableofcontents"></a></p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
        
        <p>Certain visitors to Doctor IT Services's websites choose to interact with Doctor IT Services in ways that require Doctor IT Services to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Doctor IT Services gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at <a href="https://docits.in">https://docits.in</a> to provide a username and email address.</p>
        
        <p><href="#tableofcontents"></a></p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Security</strong></p>
        
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        <p><href="#tableofcontents"></a></p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Advertisements</strong></p>
        
        <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Doctor IT Services and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
        
        <p><href="#tableofcontents"></a></p>
        
        <p><strong>5. Links to External Sites</strong></p>
        
        <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms of service of every site you visit.</p>
        
        <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites, products or services.</p>
        
        <p><href="#tableofcontents"></a></p>
        
        <p><strong>6. Doctor IT Services uses Google AdWords for remarketing</strong></p>
        
        <p>Doctor IT Services uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>
        
        <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>
        
        <p><href="#tableofcontents"></a></p>
        
        <p><strong>7. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
        
        <p>Doctor IT Services discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Doctor IT Services's behalf or to provide services available at Doctor IT Services's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Doctor IT Services's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Doctor IT Services will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Doctor IT Services discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Doctor IT Services believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Doctor IT Services, third parties or the public at large.</p>
        
        <p>If you are a registered user of <a href="https://docits.in">https://docits.in</a> and have supplied your email address, Doctor IT Services may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Doctor IT Services and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Doctor IT Services takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

        <p><strong>10. Cookies</strong></p>
        
        <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Doctor IT Services uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>

And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
        
        <p><href="#tableofcontents"></a></p>
        
        <p><strong>12. Business Transfers</strong></p>
        
        <p>If Doctor IT Services, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Doctor IT Services goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Doctor IT Services may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
        
        <p><href="#tableofcontents"></a></p>
        
        <p><strong>13. Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>
